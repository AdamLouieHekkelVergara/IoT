# Internet of Things
This repository is for an Internet of Things (IoT) project regarding routing protocol. It is created by 
@Adam Vergara and @Aksel Steen Thomassen

We wish to simulate the routing protocol RPL. This is done using the library [Simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The 'main' class contains methods to: 1) plot a DODAG.
                                      2) test 'local repair' mechanism.
                                      3) plot DODAG for two different objective functions.

The folder Version1 is somewhat outdated and only uses continous time. Version2 is the final project.
